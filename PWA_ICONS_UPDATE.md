## How It Works

### PWA Manifest Icons

When users install your PWA on their device, the system will automatically select the best icon size for their device from the manifest. The manifest now references all the icons PWA Builder generated.

### Apple Touch Icons

iOS devices specifically look for apple touch icons. These are now properly configured in your `layout.tsx` and will be used when someone adds Kitchen Sync to their iOS home screen.

### Browser Favicons

The favicons in your `/public` folder are already configured and will appear in browser tabs automatically.

## About the icons.ts File

The `icons.ts` file in your `convex/` folder was the export from PWA Builder. It contains the configuration for ALL icons (150+ variations).

**You don't need to use this file directly** - I've already extracted the important icons and added them to your manifest. The file can stay there as reference, or you can delete it - it won't affect your app.

If you ever want to add more Windows tile sizes or additional icon variations, you can reference this file to see all available icons.

## What's Still Needed

Only one visual asset remains for your launch:

### OpenGraph Social Sharing Image

**Status:** ⚠️ Not yet created

**File needed:** `/public/og-image.png`
**Size:** 1200 x 630 pixels
**Purpose:** Social media preview when sharing Kitchen Sync

**What it should include:**

- Kitchen Sync branding/logo
- Tagline: "Family Meal Planning Made Simple"
- Clean, readable design
- Your brand colors

The metadata is already configured in `layout.tsx` - just needs the image file!
