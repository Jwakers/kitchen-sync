# Kitchen Sync - Family Meal Planning Made Simple

---

### Next Immediate Steps

- [x] Complete technical debt remediation in one sprint.
- [x] Refactor to use [Vercel AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/introduction).
- [ ] Identify features that will increase my app usage
  - [x] Photograph a recipe book and import.
  - [x] Remove/expand free plan limits during beta
  - [x] Take reddit users feedback and turn it into actionable feedback points
  - [x] Import type should be a part of each recipe. This should be added to the schema.
  - [x] Recipe mode. Screen stays on, full screen, next and previous arrows etc
    - [x] Need safe are inset considered (including close button)
    - [x] Landscape should be full width dialog. Increase the max width
  - [x] Update the home page with clear messaging on these features.
- [x] URGENT: remove create your own recipe from drawer and onto its own page. It is fundamentally broken and does not work on actual devices.
- [ ] Try the post on Reddit and IH again and see if we can get any active users.
- [ ] Try out [Indie App Circle](https://www.indieappcircle.com/) too
- [ ] Try out [User Finder](https://usersfinder.com/)
- [ ] Change shopping list to meal planning. Add additional features whereby the meal plan is preserved for the week, or until an end date set by the user, easy access to then processing a shopping list. Use AI plan to make this feature better. Meal plan should be a new table.
- [ ] The app is supposed to make meal planning and weekly shops easier. Does it do that? If not yet, what are the next steps?
- [ ] Weekly meal planning features
- [ ] Set up notifications and decide what to notify users on and when to notify
      them. Add settings so users can control what they get notified about. Add to agents.md that when new relevant features get added, a notification should be considered for it too.

Meal planning notes
- [x] need to fix nav alignment
- [ ] On opening the meal plan page the nav raises up
- [x] Auto select date field on iOS needs to be disabled
- [x] If only one household exist, a quick share option should be shown
- [x] Users should be able to set the start date too. It should default to the immediate following day
- [x] Mobile meal picker needs work. Move the meal type drop-down to below the recipe name
- [x] Options ellipsis should be right aligned
- [x] Generate list should be create shopping list and should be a primary CTA
- [x] Dashboard section should have dates accompanied with the meals

### User feedback – Import experience (post-import UX)

Feedback: Import feels reliable and the edit page is clear, but the biggest opportunity is what happens _after_ import. Users want to feel confident hitting Save without having to guess what to check. The moment after import should feel rewarding, not neutral.

- [ ] **Post-import guidance**: Add guidance on the import confirmation/edit screen that highlights which fields usually matter most to review (e.g. servings, total time, category). Help users know what to check so they feel confident moving on.
- [ ] **Post-import emotional payoff**: Improve the moment right after import so it reinforces that the user has saved time and added something valuable (e.g. light celebration, clear “you’ve captured this” or “ready to cook later” messaging). The experience should match the excitement of capturing a recipe they’re keen to cook.
- [ ] **Reduce friction to Save**: Optimise the flow so users can feel comfortable hitting Save quickly—through the above guidance and payoff, so it’s less about re-checking everything and more about feeling ready.

### User feedback – Additional (Feb 2025)

Feedback: Users like the recent image-to-diagram and weekly plan features. Strong interest in food-sharing community and AI enhancements.

**Features / ideas**

- [ ] **Food-sharing community**: Users expressed interest in a community layer; consider for roadmap.
- [ ] **AI enhancements**: Nutrition analysis, cooking suggestions, personalized recipe recommendations.

**Bugs / improvements**

- [ ] **Web import accuracy**: Import quality varies by site structure; occasionally small errors. Improve parser robustness for edge cases.
- [ ] **Recipe image quality**: Images sometimes render less clearly than on the source site; review image handling/compression/resolution.
- [ ] **404 on login**: Intermittent 404 seen when logging in; investigate and fix.

### Social, SEO and AEO

- Confirm branding identity, logo and name etc
- Set up a blogging system for the site (sanity or similar CMS)
- Set up social channels: TikTok and X

## 🐛 Bug Tracking

- [ ] Ingredients can be duplicated if used in multiple sections of a recipe, like this one for example: <https://www.greatbritishchefs.com/recipes/salmon-kilaw-recipe>
      Ingredients should be deduped as part of the parsing process OR ingredients should be sectioned (as in for the sauce, for the garnish) that was they can stay as duplicates
- [ ] Its is possible for the parser to output technically correct but odd ingredient mappings like 0.5 Whole Lime. This can be seen when extracting this recipe: <https://www.greatbritishchefs.com/recipes/salmon-kilaw-recipe>
- [ ] Overflow issue on shopping page (IOS)
- [ ] Recipe page loading skeleton overflows
- [ ] Whene deleting a household an error is surfaced on the client. This is likely due to that household no longer being available. Instead we should redirect or 404
- [ ] The back to dashboard button on the error page does not seem to work

## Tech debt

- [ ] Image upload needs some work. Need to decouple logic from the FE with hooks and create reusable components for upload.
- [ ] Shopping list is very complex. A refactor is needed keeping all state at the root and reducing complexity where possible. Components should be abstracted where possible and optimistic updates should also be added. This needs to be done manually and not with AI.

## Minor updates

- [ ] Recipe description needs clamping or moving on mobile
- [ ] Handle my-recipe pagination (limit to 20 per page)
- [ ] Add client side compression to before uploading images using browser-image-compression
- [ ] Add a utility function to output image sizes string
- [ ] On recipe pages add a "Mise en place" section that shows all the preparations steps based on what ingredients have preparation set
- [ ] Update the UI for selecting units and prep to show categories and share across all forms. Use a categorised table like display
- [ ] Sign in / Sign up pages should respect dark mode as well as looking a bit more native to the site
- [ ] Add OpenGraph meta information to all pages.
- [ ] Separate 404 for home (site) and app. They need different redirects and copy
- [ ] Pages that have been made server side just for meta data and then export a client component for all logic can now include that logic directly and shift any metadata or server information to the layout file of the page (see invitations page).
- [ ] Should be able to trigger the add recipe navigation from anywhere. Time to add it to its own page or wrap the app in context to provide a method to open it.
- [ ] The theme options in the menu are a drop down that opens downwards. This does not look great the options to expand open or the menu should be above not below
- [x] Refactor the AI sections to use the vercel AI SDK
- [ ] On the pricing page the free trial is not at all mentioned on the pro plan
- [ ] Support pages should be nested under the main site and public

## Major updates

- [ ] Using sharp JS. Set up an endpoint in convex where I can transform images and render them at more appropriate sizes using a custom image loader in next image.
- [ ] Custom convex endpoint to handle image uploads so I can more readily enforce image upload limits.
- [ ] Add macros to recipe schema, add a generate macros button that AI does for you. Go back into the schema scraper and get nutrition data if available
- [ ] use a KV store or other caching strategy to cache AI parsed recipes to prevent processing more than once.
- [ ] AI image upscaler for poor quality images (PRO feature)
- [ ] Stream the AI response for better perceived performance. This may involve two separate calls, one, a human readable response of recipe text, then a final call to coalesce it into structured JSON
- [ ] Share to the app. Investigate whether it is possible that, if a website is shared to this app, it can be immediately added to the import URL field on the import URL field, with a popup asking for confirmation to import this recipe
- [ ] Add notes to recipes. This should be a new table (with a by_recipe_id index) so notes can be used for wider use cases down the line. Notes are not comments, they are private to the user and that should be made clear in the UI
- [ ] Invites sent to users should open their app, not the browser. This may be possible with protocol handlers but it is not well supported at time of writing. Else a PWA app wrapper will need to be used.
- [ ] Set up multi tenant in vercel/next and serve the app a subdomain app.kitchen-sync-app.com and the site through the main domain
- [ ] AI helper. I need to use vectors of all the user data so the AI can pick a meal plan for you. Save a meal plan for the week. Create shopping lists etc. Its a big feature but will be a helpful one, especially if it can look at previous weeks meal plans and adjust accordingly to keep things varied.
