  - [x] Image upload, storage and edit (from form and page)
  - [x] Method image upload and edit

  - [x] Display ingredients and methods
  - [x] Edit ingredients and methods
- [ ] Generate a recipe with recipe schema (parsed with AI)
  - [ ] Save recipe
  - [ ] Edit before saving
  - [ ] Handle main image
  - [ ] Data parser should be aware nutrition values should be returns as integers that represent gram values. So some conversion may be needed.
- [ ] Generate a recipe with scraping
- [ ] Generate a recipe with copy and pasting
- [ ] **Ingredient Categories**: Add categorization to ingredients (meat, poultry, vegetable, spice etc) (or extract from an existing external ingredient DB while still allowing custom ingredients)
- [ ] **Recipe Tags**: Auto-detect dietary tags like plant-based, coeliac friendly, gluten free from ingredients

## üêõ Bug Tracking

<!-- Add bugs here as you encounter them -->

## Minor updates

- [ ] When a recipe is saved from the create recipe form, give the users a link in the toast to the new recipe page
- [ ] Handle my-recipe pagination (limit to 20 per page)
- [ ] Add client side compression to before uploading images using browser-image-compression
- [ ] Add a utility function to output image sizes string
- [ ] On recipe pages add a "Mise en place" section that shows all the preparations steps based on what ingredients have preparation set

## Major updates

- [ ] Using sharp JS. Set up an endpoint in convex where I can transform images and render them at more appropriate sizes using a custom image loader in next image.
- [ ] Custom convex endpoint to handle image uploads so I can more readily enforce image upload limits.
- [ ] Add macros to recipe schema, add a generate macros button that AI does for you. Go back into teh schema scraper and get nutrition data if available
- [ ] use a KV store or other caching strategy to cache AI parsed recipes to prevent processing more than once.
