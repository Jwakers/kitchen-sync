# Kitchen Sync - Family Meal Planning Made Simple

### Next Immediate Steps

- [x] Households
- [x] Make households a link sharing thing, not an email thing (that can come later). Anyone that gets the link can join (link can be used once). Email not required. Add a native share button so users can choose how they want to share, include open graph information so this makes sense to the user too.
- [x] UI refinements from initial build
- [x] Clicking the share button does not consider the recipe being already shared.
- [ ] Add an error boundary
- [ ] Add loading page for all household pages
- [ ] The link sharing was successful however I was shown an error state on the receiving end
- [ ] Clean up stale invitations from the DB (cron)
- [ ] Link styling, open graph does not look good
- [ ] The user needs to copy the link into the browser, or when they click it, it will open the browser, instead, it should open their app.

## üêõ Bug Tracking

<!-- Add bugs here as you encounter them -->

- [ ] When the recipe form updates it will always upload images even if they already exists. The method should check for images first before uploading. In the recipe form, method image edits should not be possible and be handled in the recipe page.
- [ ] On desktop when opening the drawer on dashboard, the nav shoots up the page. Need a new utility class that handles 100% full dynamic height - navigation height
- [ ] Form inputs are awkward for required number values like prep time with leading zeros (note cook time is no longer required)

## Tech debt

- [x] Consolidate how ingredients, method and nutrition data is rendered
- [ ] Consolidate how cook time/serves/prep looks
- [ ] Consolidate form schemas
- [ ] Consolidate the two AI recipe parse functions
- [ ] Create limits and restrictions rules like image uploads in one place and share across the app. Single source of truth
- [ ] Consolidate all image upload UI and functionality
- [ ] Store app name in a global const and replace all instances with it
- [ ] Consolidate recipe card designs and reusability

## Minor updates

- [ ] Background and colours on android look really ugly for some reason
- [ ] When a recipe is saved from the create recipe form, give the users a link in the toast to the new recipe page
- [ ] Recipe description needs clamping or moving on mobile
- [ ] Handle my-recipe pagination (limit to 20 per page)
- [ ] Add client side compression to before uploading images using browser-image-compression
- [ ] Add a utility function to output image sizes string
- [ ] On recipe pages add a "Mise en place" section that shows all the preparations steps based on what ingredients have preparation set
- [ ] Update the UI for selecting units and prep to show categories and share across all forms. Use a categorised table like display
- [ ] Set recipe to draft or publish (users should be notified what this means. Published does not mean public, users in your house can see your recipes etc. This should be globally saved information so its easy to update)
- [ ] Sign in / Sign up pages should respect dark mode as well as looking a bit more native to the site
- [ ] Update app icons.
- [ ] Add OpenGraph meta information to all pages.
- [ ] Separate 404 for home (site) and app. They need different redirects and copy
- [x] Update sticky bottom calc accounting for navbar; currently: `bottom-[calc(64px+env(safe-area-inset-bottom))]`
- [ ] On saving a recipe from teh create recipe form the users should be guided to it and the form drawer should close
- [ ] Pages that have been made server side just for meta data and then export a client component for all logic can now include that logic directly and shift any metadata or server information to the layout file of the page (see invitations page).

## Major updates

- [ ] Using sharp JS. Set up an endpoint in convex where I can transform images and render them at more appropriate sizes using a custom image loader in next image.
- [ ] Custom convex endpoint to handle image uploads so I can more readily enforce image upload limits.
- [ ] Add macros to recipe schema, add a generate macros button that AI does for you. Go back into teh schema scraper and get nutrition data if available
- [ ] use a KV store or other caching strategy to cache AI parsed recipes to prevent processing more than once.
- [ ] AI image upscaler for poor quality images (PRO feature)
- [ ] Stream the AI response for better perceived performance. This may involve two separate calls, one, a human readable response of recipe text, then a final call to coalesce it into structured JSON
- [ ] Share to the app. Investigate whether it is possible that, if a website is shared to this app, it can be immediately added to the import URL field on the import URL field, with a popup asking for confirmation to import this recipe
- [ ] Add notes to recipes. This should be a new table (with a by_recipe_id index) so notes can be used for wider use cases down the line. Notes are not comments, they are private to the user and that should be made clear in the UI

### Kitchen Chalkboard

A place to ad hoc add things you need for your kitchen, this can be optionally merged into shopping lists when they are created. You should also be able to have shared boards with households so everyone can add to it.

- [ ] Create basic UI
- [ ] Create add remove edit features
- [ ] Add to database + schema setup
- [ ] Household sharing options (these should be a separate board generated automatically / Or shown automatically if already made)
- [ ] When the board is added to the shopping list all items should be scheduled to be removed from the DB after prompting (can use a toast undo action for this with a longer timer on the scheduling to give us chance to undo the action)
