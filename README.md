# Kitchen Sync - Family Meal Planning Made Simple

### Next Immediate Steps

- [x] **Connect Recipe Form**: Submit recipe data to Convex
- [ ] **Build Recipe List**: Display user recipes in dashboard (with CRUD features)
  - [ ] View recipe page
  - [ ] Action dropdown, edit, delete etc
- [ ] **Ingredient Categories**: Add categorization to ingredients (meat, poultry, vegetable, spice etc) (or extract from an existing external ingredient DB while still allowing custom ingredients)
- [ ] **Recipe Tags**: Auto-detect dietary tags like plant-based, coeliac friendly, gluten free from ingredients

### FORM ISSUES

- Change how the form works, use three independent forms. Each updating the recipe in the DB (in a draft state) then, confirm sets it to active.
- Before starting a new recipe, warn of any draft ones and offer to continue with those instead
- ALL form data is lost when the drawer closes

## üêõ Bug Tracking

<!-- Add bugs here as you encounter them -->

- [ ] **Bug**: [Description] - [Date found]

## Minor updates

- [ ] When a recipe is saved from the create recipe form, give the users a link in the toast to the new recipe page
